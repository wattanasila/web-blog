Thank you for your feedback. To address your question about the "Edit" and "Delete" buttons:

Click on "Read More" and then on the post "title" to access the edit and delete options. I chose to hide these buttons to streamline the user interface and reduce visual clutter, making the interface cleaner and more user-friendly. However, I recognize that this may not be immediately intuitive for all users.

My goal was to prioritize simplicity and focus, but I understand the importance of clear instructions and user-specific controls. I am actively working on improving the UI to make these actions more apparent and to ensure that only authorized users can edit or delete posts.

Thank you for your patience and understanding as I continue to enhance the platform. Your feedback is invaluable to me.
